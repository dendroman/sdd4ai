## 🎯 Overview

### Purpose
Manages all file and directory operations for project creation with AI-friendly structure and operation tracking.

### Responsibilities
- Execute file system operations (create, copy, template processing)
- Ensure directory structure exists before file operations
- Provide path resolution and validation
- Handle file system errors gracefully
- Support both absolute and relative path operations

## 🔌 Interface

### Inputs
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| basePath | string | Yes | Base directory for all operations |
| operation | FileSystemOperation | Yes | Operation to execute |

### Outputs
| Return | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| CommandResult | Object | Success/failure status with details |

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- [x] Node.js fs.promises for async file operations
- [x] path module for path resolution
- [x] FileSystemOperation and CommandResult types

### Key Methods
1. **executeOperation():** Main method for executing file system operations
2. **ensureDirectory():** Creates directory structure if it doesn't exist
3. **createFile():** Creates a file with specified content
4. **copyFile():** Copies file from source to destination
5. **exists():** Checks if a path exists
6. **getAbsolutePath():** Resolves relative paths to absolute paths

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Recursive directory creation
- ✅ File creation with content
- ✅ File copying operations
- ✅ Path existence checking
- ✅ Error handling with detailed results
- ✅ Absolute/relative path resolution

### Related Components
- [Template Engine](./template-engine.md) - Handles template-based file creation
- [Command Handler](./command-handler.md) - Orchestrates file system operations

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Directory creation operations
- [ ] File creation with various content types
- [ ] File copying operations
- [ ] Error handling for invalid paths
- [ ] Path resolution functionality

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Complex directory structure creation
- [ ] File operations in nested directories
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **Promise-based API:** Uses fs.promises for consistent async operations
- **Error wrapping:** Returns CommandResult objects instead of throwing
- **Path safety:** Always resolves paths relative to basePath
- **Recursive creation:** Automatically creates parent directories

### AI-Friendly Features
- Structured operation results for easy parsing
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Consistent interface for all file operations
- Path resolution that prevents directory traversal

### Future Enhancements
- Add file content validation
- Implement atomic operations for complex file changes
- Add progress tracking for large file operations
- Support for file compression and archiving
